While working in a retail store. I spent down
		time learning about building a new website for the shop. Something magic happened and I easily
		found myself addicted. One realm of learning bled into another. As the wealth of knowledge grew,
		so did the interest in learning more. I've done it for fun, but I want to use my skills to help
		people who need it.</p> <p>I do spend some time with fun things like going to concerts, playing video games or working in
		the yard. Hiking, walking the dog and backpacking is another nice escape from everything else.</p> <img alt="a sunny day on top of a mountain at a lake.
